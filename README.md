# RealTimeBusTracker
This repository has tracked the path of the M1 bus in NYC from Harlem to Broadway. It is a work in progress as I still try and figure out how to make the realtime bus information functional. Any tips are welcome!

Future improvements include fixing the real time data fetching for bus info and location. Also adding more bus lines, or adding a pin with the real time locations.
